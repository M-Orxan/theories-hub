What are the differences between Array and ArrayList?

Here are the key differences between an Array and an ArrayList in C#:

Size:

Array: The size is fixed once it is initialized. You cannot add or remove elements after it is created.
ArrayList: The size is dynamic. You can add or remove elements at runtime, and it will automatically resize.


Type-Safety:

Array: Arrays are type-safe, meaning they store elements of a specified type (e.g., int[], string[]).
ArrayList: ArrayList is not type-safe.
It stores object types, meaning you can store different types of elements in the same ArrayList, but it requires casting when retrieving elements.


Performance:

Array: Since the size is fixed and it is strongly typed, arrays generally have better performance than ArrayLists.
ArrayList: ArrayLists have a slight performance overhead because they store elements as object and involve boxing/unboxing when handling
value types like int, double, etc.
