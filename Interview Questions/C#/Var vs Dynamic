The variables are declared using var keyword are statically typed.
The variables are declared using dynamic keyword are dynamically typed.


The type of the variable is decided by the compiler at compile time.	
The type of the variable is decided by the compiler at run time.


The variable of this type should be initialized at the time of declaration. So that the compiler will decide the type of the variable according to the value it initialized.
The variable of this type need not be initialized at the time of declaration. Because the compiler does not know the type of the variable at compile time.



If the variable does not initialized it throw an error.	
If the variable does not initialized it will not throw an error.



Once the type is inferred, you cannot assign a value of a different type to that variable.
You can assign values of different types to a dynamic variable because it doesn't have a static type.
