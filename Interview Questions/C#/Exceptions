How do we handle exceptions in C#(try/catch)?

In C#, exceptions are handled using try, catch, finally, and throw blocks. Here's a breakdown of how each of these is used:

try block: This is where you place code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs, the flow of execution moves to the catch block.

catch block: This block handles the exception. You can have multiple catch blocks for different types of exceptions, or a generic one to handle any exception.

finally block: This is optional and is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
It's often used for clean-up tasks like closing files or releasing resources.

throw keyword: This is used to explicitly throw an exception. You can throw built-in exceptions or custom ones.
