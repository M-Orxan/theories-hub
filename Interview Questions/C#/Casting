1. Explain casting,implicit casting and explicit casting

Type conversion happens when we assign the value of one data type to another.
If the data types are compatible, then C# does Automatic Type Conversion ot it's called Implicit type casting. 
If not comparable, then they need to be converted explicitly which is known as Explicit Type conversion. 

Implicit Type Casting / Automatic Type Conversion
It happens when:
•	The two data types are compatible.
•	When we assign value of a smaller data type to a bigger data type.


Explicit Type Casting
It happens when:
•	The two data types are compatible.
•	When we assign value of a bigger data type to a smaller data type.

It's done by using the cast operator (type).
double x = 10.5;
int y = (int)x;

2. What can happen during explicit casting ?

In explicit casting there is a possibility of data loss. That's why we need to use cast operator. The compiler warns that we can have data loss
