Why do we need the out keyword?

The goal of out keyword is to return multiple values from a function.
Here we pass arguments to methods by reference, allowing the method to return multiple values through its parameters.

When using out, the caller is not required to initialize the variable before passing it to the method.
The method is responsible for assigning a value to the out parameter.

In the method signature, you must explicitly declare the parameters as out.
When calling the method, the corresponding arguments must also be preceded by the out keyword.
