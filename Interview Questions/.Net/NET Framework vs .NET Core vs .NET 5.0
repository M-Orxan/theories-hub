NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET 5.0

.NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET, first released in 2002 by Microsoft. It only supports Windows.
.NET Core was introduced in 2016 as a cross-platform, open-source reimplementation of .NET.
It was designed to address the limitations of the .NET Framework, particularly in terms of cross-platform support.
.NET 5.0, released in November 2020. It's is a unification platform which unifies all the .NET frameworks into one umbrella giving you a unified and
a common experience. 

Second point is about performance.
.NET Core performance is better than .Net Framework because they have divided big big DLLs into small small pieces.
We are loading only what we need and not the unnecessary things. And the memory footprint becomes less and so that performance increases 


Next point as about CLI Tools support
.NET Framework traditionally does not have a dedicated command-line interface. It's IDE based
.NET Core supports CLI tools
