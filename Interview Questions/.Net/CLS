Explain CLS 

The Common Language Specification (CLS) is a set of basic rules and guidelines in .NET that ensures interoperability between different .NET languages.
These rules specify what features and behaviors all .NET languages must support in order to work together seamlessly.

CLS ensures that code written in one .NET language can be used by another language without issues.
Because different languages in the .NET ecosystem have their own unique features and syntax.

CLS is a subset of the Common Type System (CTS).
While CTS defines all possible types in .NET, CLS defines a more restricted set of types and language features that all languages must support.
