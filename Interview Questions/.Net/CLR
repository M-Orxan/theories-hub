What is CLR?

CLR stands for Common Language Runtime. It is a runtime execution environment of .NET. CLR helps to execute your .NET application.
There are two primary things the CLR does. First it converts IL code to native language to machine language.
Second it runs the application and when the application runs any kind of unused memory of the application is consumed by garbage collector.
CLR is also responsible for garbage collector.
