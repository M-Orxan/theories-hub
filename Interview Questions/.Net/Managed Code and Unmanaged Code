What is Managed Code and Unmanaged Code?

Managed code is code that is executed within a runtime environment. C# and other .NET languages typically produce managed code.

Unmanaged code refers to code that is executed outside the confines of a runtime environment.
In unmanaged environments, developers have more direct control over memory allocation and deallocation, and there may be fewer runtime checks
and services provided by the platform.
Code written in languages like C or C++ is unmanaged. In such languages, developers have to explicitly manage memory, handle type conversions, 
and deal with other low-level details.
