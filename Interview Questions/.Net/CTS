What is the importance of CTS?

Common Type System ensures whichever language you coding your data types will get mapped to a Common data type of the .NET framework.
CTS defines a common set of data types (int, float, string, etc.) that all .NET languages must follow.
This ensures that a data type like int has the same size and behavior, regardless of the language you are using.
So that developers can use libraries written in one language in another seamlessly.
Because each programming language has its own way to declare variables.
