What is a Class and Object ?

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
In OOP languages, to build an object, we first need to model it. To create this object, you will need to define a class. 
It defines the properties (also called attributes or fields) and behaviors (also known as methods or functions) that the objects created from the class
will have. Itâ€™s a type of object.

Object is an instance of class.
