1. What is method overriding?

Method overriding allows us to define some logic in the parent class which can be overridden in the child class.
To perform method overriding, we use keywords "virtual" and "override".
virtual keyword: Applied to a method in the base class to allow it to be overridden in a derived class.
override keyword: Used in the derived class to override the base class method.
The base class provides a default implementation, but the derived class can provide a specific implementation that fits the needs of that derived class.
If any member within a class is a virtual member, the decision about whether it is coming from that class itself or from any derived class is made at runtime.

2. What is method overloading?

Method overloading in C# is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.
The signature of a method includes the number of parameters, the types of parameters, or their order.
