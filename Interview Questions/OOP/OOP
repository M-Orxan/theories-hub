1. Why do we need OOP?

Objective programming helps us to think in terms of real world objects. It offers us the ability to simulate real life itself in software development.

Letâ€™s say we write application for library system. Here we will have books. So we create Book class. And it has name so we create name property.
What else we have for library. We have authors so we create author class. It has name, surname so we crate properties for name and surname.
And Author class is allocated to Book class.
Because each book must have author or authors. We write another property for Book class which is property author to connect these 2 classes. And so on...

2.  What are the important pillars in OOP?

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods, restricting access to certain parts.
Abstraction: Showing only what is necessary
Inheritance: Parent-child relationshi. Inheriting properties and methods from a parent class.
Polymorphism:  Object can act differently under different conditions
