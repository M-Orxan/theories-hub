Abstraction VS Encapsulation

Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of a system by showing only the necessary details.
It focuses on exposing only essential information and hiding the implementation details.
It helps to reduce complexity and allows focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.


Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting
access to some of the object's components. It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface.
It helps to protect the internal state of an object and prevents unintended interference and misuse.
