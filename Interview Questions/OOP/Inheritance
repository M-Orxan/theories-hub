Explain Inheritance 

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class.
It establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. Here the class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class is called base class.
And the class that inherits the properties and methods of another class is called derived class.
