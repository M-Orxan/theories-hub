A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
You can think of it like a line of people waiting to buy tickets: the person who arrives first is served first.

Key Operations
	Enqueue: Add an element to the back of the queue.
	Dequeue: Remove and return the front element of the queue.
	Peek (or Front): Return the front element without removing it from the queue.
	Clear: Remove all items from the queue.
	Count: Return the number of elements in the queue.
