Data structures are containers that organize and store data in computer memory. They define the organization, 
management, and manipulation of data, allowing for efficient access, insertion, deletion, and modification operations.

Data structures can be categorized into two main types: linear and nonlinear.
•	Linear Data Structures: Linear data structures organize data elements in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next elements.
Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

•	Nonlinear Data Structures: Nonlinear data structures organize data elements in a hierarchical or non-sequential manner, where each element can have multiple connections to other elements. 
Examples include trees, graphs, and hash tables.

Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved.
