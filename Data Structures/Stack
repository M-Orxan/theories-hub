A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
You can think of it like a stack of plates: you add to the top and remove from the top.

Key Operations of a Stack
	Push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
	Pop: Remove and return the item from the top of the stack.
	Peek: Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
	Count: Gets the number of elements in the stack.
	Contains(T item): Checks if the stack contains a specific item. Returns true if the item is found; otherwise, false.
	Clear(): Removes all items from the stack.
